## Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is a crucial step in NLP, involving tasks like cleaning and preparing text data for analysis. Common preprocessing steps include removing special characters, lowercasing, and handling missing data.

## Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking text into individual words or tokens. It is a fundamental step in NLP as it allows computers to understand and process text on a word-level basis.

## Stop Word Removal

Stop words are common words (e.g., "and," "the," "in") that are often removed from text during preprocessing. They do not carry significant meaning and can be noise in NLP tasks.

## Text Vectorization

Text vectorization is the process of converting text data into numerical vectors that machine learning models can work with. Techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) are common for this purpose.

## NLP Libraries

There are several popular NLP libraries and frameworks, including NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, that provide tools and pre-trained models to facilitate NLP tasks.

This README provides a high-level overview of NLP techniques and methodologies. Depending on specific NLP task, this project can be extend to building ML model and deployment for specific needs.
